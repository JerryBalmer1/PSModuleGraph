function Get-VSCodeLauncher {

    .SYNOPSIS
        Path to the VS Code CLI when the session is running inside VS Code, else $null.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Both conditions have to hold. Being able to find the 'code' executable
        only means VS Code is installed somewhere; it does not mean the user is
        sitting in it. Opening an editor window at someone running from a plain
        console would be worse than opening their browser.

        Detection markers, any of which is enough:
          TERM_PROGRAM=vscode      the integrated terminal sets this
          VSCODE_PID               set inside the extension host
          VSCODE_GIT_IPC_HANDLE    set when VS Code's git integration is live
          VSCODE_INJECTION         set by shell integration injection

        Note the VS Code CLI has no --command or --uri flag, so nothing here can
        open a rendered preview pane; only the file itself can be opened. See
        Show-GraphDocument.
